        Hey there! My name is Nick and I am an aspiring web developer. I've done
        IT for close to 10 years now and am looking to branch out to new
        horizons. The bulk of my experience with IT has been focused on
        supporting various different military commands and government agencies.
        I've always been interested in creating things and problem solving.
        Inherently, the nature of IT is about problem solving, so it was an easy
        transition to that as a career. However, it never truly felt like home
        because I was always fixing something that was broken rather than
        creating new stuff. After some convincing, one of my closest friends got
        me to sit down and take some courses on JavaScript and I fell in love
        with both the creation and problem solving. I've been completely
        "self-taught". Which is to say a lot of researching issues, a lot of
        self paced courses, and a lot of collaboration with my friends who are
        in the industry to develop new skills and work my way towards doing this
        as a full-time job. If you'd like to see my work, head on over to the
        resume section; if you'd like to get to know me better, head to the
        About section; and if you're looking to reach out, head over to the, you
        guessed it, contact section.
