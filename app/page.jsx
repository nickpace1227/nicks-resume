        Hey there! My name is Nick and I am an aspiring web developer. I've done
        IT for close to 10 years now and am looking to branch out to new
        horizons.

        The bulk of my experience with IT has been focused on supporting various
        different military commands and government agencies. I've always been
        interested in creating things and problem solving. Inherently, the
        nature of IT is about problem solving, so it was an easy transition to
        that as a career. However, it never truly felt like home because I was
        always fixing something that was broken rather than creating new stuff.
        After some convincing, one of my closest friends got me to sit down and
        take some courses on JavaScript and I fell in love with both the
        creation and problem solving. I've been completely "self-taught". Which
        is to say a lot of researching issues, a lot of self paced courses, and
        a lot of collaboration with my friends who are in the industry to
        develop new skills and work my way towards doing this as a full-time
        job.

        I graduated from USF in 2016. I have a passion for playing TTRPGs, think
        Dungeons & Dragons, video games, and reading. I've been known to enjoy
        hiking, and doing, mostly, wildlife photography. I've got 2 dogs and am
        recently married.
